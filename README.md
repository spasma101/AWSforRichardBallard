### Architecture and Tech
Itâ€™s a standard MVC web project that uses Umbraco (v7.7.4)

The bookflow integrates with AW's backend system called Metrix. This is a standard soap webservice that is included in the project.

The Umbraco Models are built via Umbraco API rather than the DLLs.
[More info on the models builder api here](https://24days.in/umbraco-cms/2016/getting-started-with-modelsbuilder/) Scroll down to the API Models section.
